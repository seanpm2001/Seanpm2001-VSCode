# Seanpm2001 VSCode

I am new to Visual Studio Code extensions. I want to create some for my computing language projects, as it would be nice for them to work in different environments.

## Listing

As of 2023, Wednesday, May 31st at 10:40 pm, I have 2 VSCode extension repositories for 2 computing languages, which include:

- [:octocat: `DSergeant (VSCode)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/DSergeant-VSCode/)
- [:octocat: `URLL (VSCode)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/URLL-VSCode/)

I plan to create more in the future.
